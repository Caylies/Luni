# Luni Contribution

Hey, thanks for contributing to Lunu! This guide explains how you can set up Luni's development environment for both the plugin and the documentation.

## Environment Setup

### Plugin Environment

*TBA*

### Documentation Environment

Luni uses Python for its documentation. You can serve the website using [MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

1. [Install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. Run `uv run mkdocs serve`
3. You may edit the documentation and view the changes live.
