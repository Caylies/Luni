Luni is a Luau linter that delivers real-time diagnostics directly inside **Roblox Studio**, helping you maintain clean, consistent code as you write.

- ⚠️ **Live script editor warnings**

Luni was inspired by **Astral's Ruff** (a Python linter) and was created to solve a common problem in Roblox development: enforcing consistent code style *without* relying on external editors or third-party tools like VS Code.
